# Dockerizing an Angular app

Dockerizing an Angular app is quite easy. I will show you how to do that in this
document's first part.

It gets a litte bit more complicated to follow Docker's "Build once, run
anywhere" motto. The document's second part will show you a possible solution to
this challenge.

I won't explain any Docker concepts here. I'm sure you'll easily be able to find
a documentation or tutorial fitting your needs.

## Part I: The Simple Case

To run an Angular app inside a Docker container without further configuration
from the outside, you don't have to change any code in your app. All you've got
to do is to add some files and edit them to match your app's name and the target
environment's port the app should listen to.

### Files To Add

Add the following two files:

-   Create an `nginx` directory and put a `default.conf` file inside:

    ```nginx
    client_max_body_size 0;
    server_tokens off;
    server_names_hash_bucket_size 64;

    server {
      listen 80;
      server_name localhost;

      location / {
        root /usr/share/nginx/html;
        index index.html;

        try_files $uri $uri/ /index.html;
      }
    }
    ```

-   Create a `Dockerfile`

    ```dockerfile
    FROM nginx
    LABEL maintainer="Michael Kaaden <github@kaaden.net>"
    COPY nginx/default.conf /etc/nginx/conf.d
    COPY dist/dockerized-app /usr/share/nginx/html
    ```

These two files are sufficient to build the Docker image containing your Angular
app.

Too keep the image as small as possible, you should create a `.dockerignore`
file to prevent too many files and directories to be added to your image

```
.dockerignore
.editorconfig
.git
.gitignore
.idea
README.md
angular.json
coverage
e2e
node_modules
package.json
package-lock.json
src
tsconfig.json
tslint.json
yarn.lock
```

If you're like me, you love automating steps you need to repeat often (and which
you will most likely forget if another project draws your attention). Because of
this, I'm using the following two scripts:

-   A `dockerize.sh` script to automate building the image (use `npm` instead of
    `yarn`, if necessary):

    ```bash
    #!/bin/bash
    yarn --prefer-offline --no-progress
    ng build --prod
    docker build -t dockerized-app .
    ```

-   A `docker-compose.yml` to simplify the container instantiation:

    ```yaml
    version: "3"

    services:
        web:
            image: dockerized-app
            ports:
                - "8093:80"
    ```

-   A `redeploy.sh` script to automate (re-)starting the container (this uses
    the `docker-compose.yml` file shown above):

    ```bash
    #! /bin/bash
    export COMPOSE_HTTP_TIMEOUT=300
    docker-compose down --remove-orphans
    docker-compose up -d
    ```

### Building And Running The Dockerized App

Now it's very easy to build and run the app with Docker:

1. Build the app and the Docker image with `./dockerize.sh`

    Example run:

    ```console
    $ ./dockerize.sh
    yarn install v1.13.0
    [1/4] 🔍  Resolving packages...
    success Already up-to-date.

    ```

2. Start the container with `./redeploy.sh`

    Example run:

    ```console
    $ ./redeploy.sh
    Stopping dockerized-app_web_1 ... done
    Removing dockerized-app_web_1 ... done
    Removing network dockerized-app_default
    Creating network "dockerized-app_default" with the default driver
    Creating dockerized-app_web_1 ... done
    ```

3. Visit `http://localhost:8093` (that's the port defined in the
   `docker-compose.yml` file)

## Part II: Build Once, Run Anywhere

Think of a typical development process that requires the following environments:
Development, testing, staging, and production. In each of these, you will
probably at least need a different base URL pointing to the location where the
backend resides.

In the first environment, the app needs to run wth `ng serve` and
`ng serve --prod` from your shell. So you need some ability to inject the "base
URL" as I'm going to call it into your app without any Docker container running.

In the other environments, Docker needs to overwrite the base URL you need for
development with the one fitting into to the individual environment consisting
of many containers being carefully linked together. You need to somehow inject
the base URL here, too.

One thing should be clear: You don't want to build a new image containing your
Angular app for each of these environments. The tested image is the one you want
to deploy in staging and production. Why? Because on the build system, things
might have changed between the first and the next build. For example, a new npm
release might have crept in. You might have updated global packages. Someone
might have made a tiny hotfix in your code base. All of these might result in a
slightly different build that is different from the one you had tested
thoroughly.

What you need is a configurable image that works in every environment. We'll
concentrate on the base URL. All other configurations should work the same way.

First of all, we need some mechanism to load the app configuration at runtime.
If we'd use Angular's `environment.ts` for this purpose, the value would need to
be set at _build time_. That's too early. So, what we need to do is put the
configuration in some file which we'll place in the `assets` folder. This way,
we can easily overwrite the file when composing the container, i. e. at
_runtime_. We'll see how to do this in a moment.

Here's the `src/assets/settings.json` file that we'll use:

```json
{
    "baseUrl": "http://localhost:5002"
}
```

Let's define a `Settings` interface that defines the config file's structure:

```typescript
export interface Settings {
    baseUrl: string;
}
```

Now we need a `SettingsService` that we simply inject whenever we need to access
the settings.

```typescript
import { Injectable } from "@angular/core";
import { Settings } from "../models/settings";

@Injectable({
    providedIn: "root",
})
export class SettingsService {
    settings: Settings;
}
```

There's one thing we need to cope with when we're retrieving the settings from
the JSON file: The app already needs its settings when it's launching, but the
settings are retrieved via an HTTP call, which is done asynchronously.
Thankfully, Angular introduced the concept of an `APP_INITIALIZER` for that. I
won't go into detail here. The point is: The app awaits the `APP_INITIALIZER`'s
result before continuing to initialize, and that's exactly what we need here.

So, here's the `SettingsInitializerService` that is responsible for loading the
`Settings`:

```typescript
import { HttpClient } from "@angular/common/http";
import { Injectable } from "@angular/core";
import { Settings } from "../models/settings";
import { SettingsService } from "./settings.service";

@Injectable({
    providedIn: "root",
})
export class SettingsInitializerService {
    constructor(private http: HttpClient, private settings: SettingsService) {}

    initializeSettings(): Promise<any> {
        return new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
            this.http
                .get("assets/settings.json")
                .toPromise()
                .then((response) => {
                    this.settings.settings = response as Settings;
                    resolve();
                })
                .catch((error) => reject(error));
        });
    }
}
```

Finally, the app needs to load the settings during startup. This is done in the
`app.module.ts` file.

```typescript
import { HttpClientModule } from "@angular/common/http";
import { BrowserModule } from "@angular/platform-browser";
import { APP_INITIALIZER, NgModule } from "@angular/core";

import { AppRoutingModule } from "./app-routing.module";
import { AppComponent } from "./components/app/app.component";
import { OneComponent } from "./components/one/one.component";
import { TwoComponent } from "./components/two/two.component";
import { SettingsInitializerService } from "./services/settings-initializer.service";

export function initSettings(
    settingsInitializerService: SettingsInitializerService,
) {
    return () => settingsInitializerService.initializeSettings();
}

@NgModule({
    declarations: [AppComponent, OneComponent, TwoComponent],
    imports: [BrowserModule, AppRoutingModule, HttpClientModule],
    providers: [
        {
            provide: APP_INITIALIZER,
            useFactory: initSettings,
            deps: [SettingsInitializerService],
            multi: true,
        },
    ],
    bootstrap: [AppComponent],
})
export class AppModule {}
```

Now, the app will load the `Settings` during startup.

Well... What's still missing is the possibility to change the base URL for each
Docker container. Currently, every container would use the value set in the
`src/assets/settings.json` file.

One option to fix this is to use the `envsubst` command. This takes a template
file as input and substitutes all known environment variables with their value.

Here's the `src/assets/settings.json.template` file:

```json
{
    "baseUrl": "${BASE_URL}"
}
```

Our updated `docker-compose.yml` will now use `envsubst` to produce the correct
`src/assets/settings.json` file for each container by substituting the base URL:

```yaml
version: "3"

services:
    web:
        image: dockerized-app
        env_file:
            - ./docker.env
        ports:
            - "8093:80"
        command:
            /bin/bash -c "envsubst '$$BASE_URL' <
            /usr/share/nginx/html/assets/settings.json.template >
            /usr/share/nginx/html/assets/settings.json && exec nginx -g 'daemon
            off;'"
```

As you can see, I defined the environment inside the `docker.env` file. It looks
like this:

```bash
BASE_URL=http://some.official.server:444
```

To build and run the container, you still can use the scripts shown above. But
now the base URL will be set to the one defined in the environment.
